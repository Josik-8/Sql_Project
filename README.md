This project is a simple yet comprehensive Student Database Management System built using SQL to manage student data. The system allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete student records efficiently. It's designed to showcase how relational databases can be utilized to handle academic-related information in a structured manner.

Search Functionality: Advanced search capabilities to find students based on specific criteria.
Report Generation: Generate reports on students enrolled in various courses or departments.
Database Schema:
Students Table: Contains essential student data (ID, name, age, etc.).
Courses Table: Lists the courses available to students.
Enrollment Table: Tracks which students are enrolled in which courses.
Technologies Used:
SQL: For managing the database and performing operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN queries.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
(Optional) Frontend integration (e.g., PHP, Python, or JavaScript) for a user interface if applicable.
